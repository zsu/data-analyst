# EPA Air Quality System (AQS) Data Mart API
Depth: standard. Key: required (AQS_API_KEY plus AQS_EMAIL). Ambient air pollution measured at
thousands of U.S. monitors: criteria pollutants (ozone, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, lead) and more, as
annual, quarterly or daily summaries, raw samples, and monitor metadata. Historical data only.

## When to use
- Measured pollutant concentrations by state, county, site, CBSA or box; annual means and percentiles;
  daily values during episodes (wildfire smoke); which monitors operate where.
- Not here: facility emissions, toxic releases, compliance (epa: GHGRP, TRI, ECHO); today's AQI and
  forecasts (AirNow, not covered); the UV index (epa). Without a key, the same AQS data come as
  pre-generated yearly files (AirData, see Access) that the user downloads.

## Endpoints and datasets
| Endpoint | Returns | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `data` | rows of one AQS service | `service` (annualData, quarterlyData, dailyData, sampleData, monitors), `geo` (byState, byCounty, bySite, byCBSA, byBox), `param`, `bdate`, `edate`, `state`, `county`, `site`, `cbsa`, `minlat`/`maxlat`/`minlon`/`maxlon`, `duration`, `cbdate`/`cedate` |
| `list` | code lists | `list` (states, countiesByState, sitesByCounty, cbsas, classes, parametersByClass, pqaos, mas; there is no durations list: duration codes are on AQS's code-table pages), `state`, `county`, `pc` |

`param` aliases: `ozone` 44201 (ppm), `pm25` 88101 (FRM/FEM, ug/m3), `pm25_nonfrm` 88502, `pm10` 81102,
`so2` 42401 (ppb), `co` 42101 (ppm), `no2` 42602 (ppb), `lead` 14129 (ug/m3); or up to 5 codes
comma-separated. Geography needs: byState `state`; byCounty `state`+`county`; bySite +`site`; byCBSA
`cbsa`; byBox the four bounds. States may be FIPS (06), USPS (CA) or names; the pack converts them.

## Data format and traps
Unverified: the pack was built without a key, so the summary column names below (pollutant_standard,
sample_duration, observation_percent, event_type ...) follow the AQS documentation and AirData file
layouts, not a live response; check `data_dictionary.csv` after the first fetch.
- **Same-year rule**: `bdate` and `edate` must be in one calendar year (except `monitors`). The pack
  splits a longer range into one call per year (notes say how many). Annual and quarterly services use
  only the year part of the dates and return whole years.
- **Several rows per monitor**: summaries have one row per site x parameter x POC (parameter occurrence
  code: several instruments at one site) x `sample_duration` x `pollutant_standard` (and for daily
  data per day). Filter `pollutant_standard` (e.g. "Ozone 8-hour 2015", "PM25 Annual 2012") and
  `sample_duration` before averaging, or values are double counted.
- Statistics differ by standard: ozone compliance uses the 4th-highest daily maximum 8-hour average;
  PM2.5 annual uses `arithmetic_mean`, 24-hour uses the 98th percentile (`ninety_eighth_percentile`).
  These are monitor statistics, not official design values (EPA publishes those separately).
- Units are per parameter (`units_of_measure`): ozone and CO in ppm, SO2 and NO2 in ppb, PM in
  micrograms per cubic meter (local conditions for PM2.5, STP for PM10).
- Completeness: `observation_percent` and `validity_indicator` say whether a year meets data
  requirements; exclude incomplete years from trends. `event_type` separates values with and without
  exceptional events (wildfire smoke): "No Events", "Events Included", "Events Excluded".
- Data lag about 6 months and are revised until certified (`certification_indicator`,
  `date_of_last_change`).
- `sampleData` (hourly or finer) is very large: one site, one parameter, short periods. AQS asks for at
  most 1,000,000 rows per request.
- AQS returns HTTP 200 with Header status "No data matched your selection" for an empty result, and
  "Failed" (or HTTP 400) with an error list for a bad request. The documentation's example responses
  call the row list "Body"; the live API calls it "Data" (both are read).
- Codes are text with leading zeros: state "06", county "037", site "0014"; keep them as text.

## Access
Key required: a free AQS key is emailed after a sign-up request (open
https://aqs.epa.gov/data/api/signup?email=YOUR_EMAIL with your address). Store the key in `AQS_API_KEY`
(the setup script) and the registered email in `AQS_EMAIL` (an environment variable or the same
settings.json "env" block); both are sent as query parameters and never recorded. Limits (AQS terms):
no more than 10 requests a minute, a 5-second pause between requests, one request at a time; the pack
waits 5 seconds between calls, so multi-year requests take a while. Accounts that break the terms may be
disabled. Manual route without a key: EPA AirData pre-generated files,
https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html (annual_conc_by_monitor_<year>.zip,
daily_<param>_<year>.zip such as daily_88101_2023.zip; unzip, filter, upload the CSV), or
https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data. With a key elsewhere: the links in
`manual_download/INSTRUCTIONS.md` (replace `{API_KEY}` and `{AQS_EMAIL}`). Then `--ingest`.
