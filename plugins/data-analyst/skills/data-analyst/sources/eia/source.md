# EIA Open Data API v2 (U.S. Energy Information Administration)
Depth: standard. Key: optional (EIA_API_KEY; without it api.data.gov's DEMO_KEY, a few requests an
hour). Electricity, petroleum, natural gas, coal, nuclear, state energy (SEDS), Monthly Energy Review,
Short-Term and Annual Energy Outlooks, international energy, by period, state, sector and fuel.

## When to use
- Electricity prices, sales, revenue and customers by state and sector; generation and fuel use by
  state and fuel; power-plant emissions; generator capacity.
- Crude oil (WTI, Brent) and product spot prices; weekly retail gasoline and diesel prices; crude
  production, stocks, imports; natural gas prices, production, consumption; coal production.
- State energy consumption, production, prices and expenditures per capita or in total (SEDS); U.S.
  totals (Monthly Energy Review, total-energy); projections (STEO, AEO).
- Not here: the energy component of the CPI (bls), energy industry jobs (bls), energy-related federal
  spending (usaspending), greenhouse-gas inventories beyond energy CO2 (epa), international peers'
  energy use per capita when the World Bank series suffices (world-bank).

## Endpoints and datasets

## Data format and traps
- Every row carries its units: `price-units` ("cents per kilowatt-hour"), `units` ("$/BBL", "$/GAL"),
  `unit` ("Million Btu"). Read them; never assume. Prices are nominal dollars.
- Columns differ by route: retail-sales has `price`, `sales`, `revenue`, `customers` (ask for them in
  `data`); most petroleum and gas routes have `value` with `series`, `duoarea`, `product`, `process`
  descriptions. Values are numbers or numeric text; markers such as "W" (withheld), "NA" or "--"
  become empty cells with a `<column>_flag` column.
- `period` format follows the frequency: YYYY, YYYY-MM, YYYY-Q1, YYYY-MM-DD (weekly rows are dated by
  the week's day, e.g. Mondays for retail gasoline). `start`/`end` must use the same format;
  the API reads a bare year on a monthly series as January only, so the pack widens `start: 2023` /
  `end: 2023` to the whole year for monthly, quarterly, weekly, daily and hourly data (verified 2026-10).
- Facet ids are case-sensitive and differ by route: `stateid` (retail-sales, emissions), `stateId`
  (SEDS), `location` (power operations, coal). The pack's `state` fills the right one from the catalog;
  region codes (US, NEW, MAT, PACC ...) are values too. An unknown facet is an HTTP 400 with the valid
  list ("Invalid facet 'x' provided. The only valid facets are ...").
- Sector "ALL" and region totals ("US") are rows next to the parts: filter before summing.
- SEDS is annual with a lag (2024 the latest year in October 2026) and is revised each release; per
  capita uses SEDS's own population (TPOPP). Monthly series are revised; the latest months are
  preliminary. The total-energy metadata lists an end period far ahead (2121-12): always set `end`.
- Paging: `offset`/`length`, at most 5,000 rows per call; `response.total` is the full count. Default
  sort is period descending (newest first); give `"sort": "period:asc"` for oldest first.
- Routes that do not exist: coal/production (use coal/aggregate-production) and
  nuclear/status-operable-units (use nuclear-outages/us-nuclear-outages). SEDS codes TETCD and TETXB
  are average price and end-use consumption, not per-capita consumption and expenditures.

## Access
Key optional: free at https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php (the API runs on api.data.gov, so any
api.data.gov key works as EIA_API_KEY). Without a key the pack sends DEMO_KEY, which allowed 10
requests an hour from one address when checked (HTTP 429 beyond); store a key with the setup script
for real work. Route `api` when api.eia.gov answers (responses can take 10-30 seconds). Manual route:
`manual_download/INSTRUCTIONS.md` has one JSON link per 5,000 rows carrying DEMO_KEY (replace it with
your key if the hourly limit is hit); upload, then `--ingest`. Alternatives: the API browser
https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/ (CSV/Excel download) or the data pages on eia.gov.
