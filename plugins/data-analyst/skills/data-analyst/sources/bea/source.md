# Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Data API and bulk files
Depth: deep. Key: required (BEA_API_KEY) for the API; the bulk route needs none. U.S. national accounts
(GDP, income, PCE and its prices, saving, profits, government), state and county GDP and income, regional
price parities, GDP by industry, trade and international accounts, multinationals, fixed assets, input-output.

## When to use
- GDP and its growth, contributions, prices and deflators; personal income, disposable income, saving rate;
  PCE and core PCE price indexes (the Federal Reserve's inflation measure); corporate profits; NIPA
  government receipts and spending (calendar years); GDP and personal income by state and county; per capita
  income; RPPs; value added and gross output by industry; goods and services trade balances by country;
  current account; investment position; direct investment; capital stocks.
- Not here: CPI, jobs, unemployment, wages by occupation (bls); budget data by fiscal year (treasury);
  market interest rates (treasury-yields; fred); forecasts (BEA publishes history only); monthly GDP.
- The deliverable decides the work: data only (download, short preview, stop), an answer (compute in
  `analysis.py`, answer with the numbers, measure and vintage), or a report (SKILL.md's report steps).

## Endpoints and datasets
One API endpoint (`https://apps.bea.gov/api/data`, GET, key in `UserID`), 13 datasets. Bulk files serve
the most used ones without a key and count against no limit.

| `dataset` | What | Spec keys | Bulk (no key)? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NIPA` | national accounts tables `T10101` ... (titles: `--find`) | `table`, `frequency` A/Q/M, `years`, `line_code` | yes (NIPA flat files) |
| `NIUnderlyingDetail` | detail tables `U20305` ... (lower quality) | same | no (flat files hold only shared lines) |
| `FixedAssets` | `FAAt101` ... annual | `table`, `years` | no |
| `Regional` | state `SA*`/`SQ*`, county `CA*`, metro `MA*` tables | `table`, `line_code`, `geo_fips`, `years` | yes for STATE, COUNTY, postal code (its counties), FIPS lists, MARPP |
| `GDPbyIndustry` | workbook codes `TVA101`-`TVA113`, `TGO1xx`, `TII1xx` | `table`, `frequency` A/Q, `years` | yes (public workbooks) |
| `GDPbyIndustry` (API) | `TableID` 1, 5, 6, 25 ...; `Industry` filters | `params` | no |
| `UnderlyingGDPbyIndustry`, `ITA`, `IIP`, `IntlServTrade`, `IntlServSTA`, `MNE`, `InputOutput` | see `--dataset-info <name>` | `params` (raw API names) | no |

Verified lines (September 2026 vintage): T10101 line 1 real GDP percent change (annual rate); T10106 line 1
real GDP (millions of chained 2017 dollars, SAAR); T10105 line 1 nominal GDP; T10111 line 1 year-over-year
real GDP change; T10102 contributions; T20100 lines 1/27/37/35/40 personal income / DPI / real DPI / saving
rate / population (annual and quarterly only: monthly values are in T20600, whose line numbers differ, so
check them with `--lines T20600`; a table is monthly only when its title says so, and the bulk route refuses
frequency M for any other table); T20804 lines 1/25 PCE / core PCE price index (monthly; published changes: T20807 month over month, not
annualized, T20811 lines 32/37 over 12 months); T70100 lines 1/3 GDP and income
per capita (BEA divides by unrounded population: real GDP over T70100's population, published in thousands,
can miss the published per-capita level by just over 0.5 dollars; allow for that rounding in the benchmark and
say so). Federal civilian wages per FTE (T60600D) jump in 2024-2025: Deferred Resignation staff on paid
administrative leave stayed on the payroll while BEA cut the quantity of federal labor (FAQ 1479,
bea.gov/help/faq/1479): never read those years as federal pay raises; use OPM pay or the GS raise. Regional: SAGDP2/SAGDP9 line 1 all-industry total (current / chained 2017 dollars); SAINC1 and
CAINC1 lines 1/2/3 personal income / population / per capita income; SAINC4/CAINC4 lines 10/20/30; SARPP
and MARPP line 1 all-items RPP. API names may carry an `N` (`SAGDP9N`); the bulk files drop it: both work.
BEA marks nothing as preliminary in the data, but the latest quarter or year of every table is an early
estimate that BEA will revise: register facts from it with `preliminary=True` and say so. A year that has
been through an annual update (published at the end of September) is revised, not early: say "subject to
revision at the next annual update" instead.
More tables, the question-to-table map and concepts: `docs/datasets.md`. API parameters, response quirks,
error codes and limits: `docs/bea_api.md`. Report conventions: `docs/report_patterns.md`.

Discovery (no key unless noted): `--find "real gross domestic product"` (NIPA titles and workbook tables;
`--search` gives JSON), `--lines T10106` (lines and series codes), `--dataset-info ITA` (required parameters
and rules), `--endpoints`; with a key (cached a day): `--datasets`, `--params ITA`, `--values Regional
TableName`, `--values Regional LineCode --filter '{"TableName": "SAINC1"}'`.

`years`: `"2019-2025"`, a list, `"ALL"` or `"LAST5"`; `line_code`: a number, list or `"ALL"` (NIPA: BEA
sends the whole table and the rows are filtered); `geo_fips`: `STATE`, `COUNTY`, a postal code (its
counties), FIPS codes (`"06"` = `06000`). Keys a dataset does not use are reported on stderr. When a growth
rate is computed from levels, also request BEA's published percent change so it can be checked.

## Data format and traps
Output in `<out>/data/bea/`: `bea_data.csv` (tidy: `request_id, dataset, table, line, series_code,
description, geo_fips, geo_name, geo_level, industry, time_period, date, year, subperiod, frequency, value,
flag, unit, metric, unit_mult, note_ref, dims`), `notes.csv` (BEA's footnotes: units, reference year, what
the U.S. row means, flag codes), `request.json` (calls without the key, bulk files, route, vintage,
checksums) and `README.md`. Read the README and `notes.csv` before analysing (the NIPA bulk files carry no
footnotes: on the `bulk` route `notes.csv` has only the pack's own note; read a table's footnotes on its
apps.bea.gov page, or fetch it by the `api` route with a key). `line` is text (BEA's line
numbers can carry letters): select with `pick()` or compare strings, not integers.
- **Units:** `value` is as BEA prints it; base units = value x 10^`unit_mult` (`stats.load()` adds `amount`).
  Check `unit` and `metric` (current dollars, chained dollars, index, percent change) for every series.
- **Special values** `(D)` suppressed, `(NA)` not available, `(NM)` not meaningful, `(L)` under $50,000 or 10
  jobs, `(S)`, `(X)`, `(*)` (MNE: rounds to zero): `value` is empty and the code is in `flag`. Never a zero;
  `stats.flagged(df)` lists them; drop or footnote the area.
- **No sums of chained dollars**, of components or of states; shares from current dollars; drivers of growth
  from BEA's contributions tables (T10102, SAGDP11). SAAR levels are averaged, not added, for annual values.
- **Growth measures differ** by a point or more: quarterly at a compound annual rate (BEA's headline,
  `stats.growth`), year over year (`yoy`, T10111), Q4 over Q4 (`q4_over_q4`), annual average; "since <year>":
  cumulative change (`change_between`) and the average annual rate (`cagr`). Name the measure everywhere;
  test the alternatives with `sensitivity()`.
- **Check against BEA's published numbers** (`check_against_published`, docs/datasets.md section 5): growth
  from T10106 levels vs T10101; the U.S. row of SAGDP9 vs T10106 line 1. A mismatch beyond rounding is an
  error; a difference from an older release is a revision (compare dates with the vintage in README.md).
- **Vintage:** BEA serves only its latest estimates (advance, second, third; annual updates each September;
  comprehensive updates every five years). Record the release date; old vintages are at apps.bea.gov/histdata.
- **Geography:** every row has `geo_level` (nation, region, state, county, msa); a COUNTY bulk download also
  holds state and U.S. rows: filter before summing. `STATE` = 50 states + D.C. + U.S. (say whether D.C. is
  ranked). Since February 2026 BEA no longer produces GDP or personal income for metro areas: sum component
  counties' current-dollar values and say so. Rank on unrounded values; name near-ties (`near_ties()`).
- **Calendar years** everywhere (NIPA federal spending too, unlike fiscal-year budget data). NIPA line
  numbers change at comprehensive updates: check the description or series code, not only the line.
  GDP-by-industry line numbers differ between tables (TVA106 has an extra line): match by description.
- **No standard errors** exist for BEA estimates: never "statistically different".
- Analysis helpers: `lib/stats.py` (`load, pick, series, flagged, growth, yoy, cagr, change_between,
  annual_average, q4_over_q4, share, per_capita, index_to, deflate, check_against_published, rank_areas,
  near_ties, sensitivity, Facts`); the shared `scripts/analysis/factfmt.py` formats facts (`pct100:1`, `dollars_b:1`, `dollars_t:1`).
  ```python
  sys.path.insert(0, r"<skill>/sources/bea/lib"); from stats import *   # with opm/ipums: pack_lib("bea", "stats", OUT, SKILL)
  df = load(f"{OUT}/data/bea/bea_data.csv")
  g = growth(series(df, table="T10106", line=1, frequency="Q"))
  check_against_published(g, series(df, table="T10101", line=1, frequency="Q"))
  ```

## Access
- **Key** `BEA_API_KEY` (free, https://apps.bea.gov/API/signup/; BEA emails it and it works only after the
  activation link is clicked). Found by core.keys (environment, `BEA_API_KEY_FILE`, keys.json, Claude Code settings.json,
  `~/.bea/api_key`); stored with the skill's setup script (`setup.ps1 -Source bea` / `setup.sh bea`), which
  checks it with `keycheck.py`. Never ask for the key in chat. BEA puts it in the URL and echoes it in every
  reply: the pack scrubs both (core.keys.redact plus the USERID echo); code must not build its own URLs.
- **Limits** per key: 100 requests, 100 MB and 30 errors a minute; going over blocks the key for a minute to
  an hour (HTTP 429, never retried). The client spaces calls 0.75 s, waits before crossing 100 MB a minute,
  stops after 30 errors a minute or 10 in a run, validates table and line names against cached metadata
  first, and checks dataset parameter rules offline (`fix_spec`), so errors are not spent.
- **Routes** (`--check`, shared names): `fix_spec`, `reuse_existing`, `api` (key works), `bulk` (no usable
  key and every request is in the bulk files: NIPA flat files, state and county zips, GDP-by-industry
  workbooks; same latest estimates; `--prefer bulk` forces it), `run_setup` (local/ssh, a request needs the
  API), `cloud_secret`, `cloud_allowlist`, `manual_download`, `report_error` (key rejected or locked out, or
  BEA unreachable from the user's machine). Bulk files are cached in `<cache_root>/bea/bulk`
  (`DATA_ANALYST_CACHE` sets the root) and revalidated by Last-Modified; NIPA files are 12-37 MB, county zips up
  to 50 MB.
- **Manual download:** `--manual-bundle` (or the `manual_download` route) writes `<out>/manual_download/bea/`:
  `download_bea.sh` (macOS, Linux: `bash ~/Downloads/download_bea.sh`) and `download_bea.ps1` (Windows:
  `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$HOME\Downloads\download_bea.ps1"`), each a self-contained script that downloads the public files, asks for the key with hidden
  input only when an API request needs it, removes the key from every reply and prints the files to upload;
  plus `spec.json` and `INSTRUCTIONS.md` with the links and curl steps. Send both scripts and spec.json, and give
  the one command for the user's system (`user_commands`).
  Then `--ingest <files>` (the uploaded files or their folder). Say in the methods that
  the files were downloaded by hand.
- Exit codes: 0 ok; 2 BEA or spec error (fix the spec; never loop: errors count against the key); 3
  unexpected; 4 blocked (follow the printed route; never invent or recall data).
