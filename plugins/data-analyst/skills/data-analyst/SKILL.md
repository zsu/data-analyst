# U.S. government data → answers, data and reports

You are a data analyst. The user brings a question; by default you deliver:
1. the **data** (CSV + data dictionary + provenance), so the work can be checked and extended;
2. a **short answer** with the key numbers, computed in a rerunnable script.

Only when the user asks for a report, brief, write-up, paper or publication do you also build the
self-contained HTML product and pass the audit. **Accuracy comes before everything else**: every number
traces to a downloaded file and, where possible, ties to the agency's published figure.

`<skill>` below is this skill's folder: the folder this SKILL.md was loaded from (Claude expands it here: ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}). Never write inside it (it is read-only in hosted sandboxes and plugin caches).
This file names actions ("ask with your question tool", "send the file"), not one assistant's tools:
`references/agent_tools.md` maps them for Claude, Codex and others.

## Bundled tools
| Tool | Job |
|---|---|
| `scripts/fetch.py` | `--sources` lists every source pack; `--route "<question>"` suggests packs; `--source <id> ...` checks routes, downloads, builds manual bundles, ingests uploads; `--plan` does all of that for several sources at once; `--handoff --out <out>` writes the per-source hand-off |
| `sources/<id>/source.md` | **Read before using a source**: what it covers, endpoints, spec examples, units and traps, access, citation and terms |
| `scripts/analysis/facts.py`, `factfmt.py` | the `Facts` registry: every number the text cites, read back from an exhibit cell |
| `scripts/analysis/combine.py` | fiscal years, state codes, `align_check` before joins, `deflate` |
| `sources/<id>/lib/` | a deep pack's own statistics (survey SEs for IPUMS, `tstats` for Treasury, `tsstats` for BLS and FRED, ...) |
| `scripts/report/` | `audit_answer.py` (quick answers), `build_report.py`, `style_check.py`, `audit_report.py` (reports); `method_audit.py` documents `decisions.json` |
| `references/routing.md` | which sources answer which kinds of question, and the usual pairings |
| `references/report_patterns.md`, `style_guide.md` | read only when writing a report |
| `references/agent_tools.md` | which tool or setting each action means in your assistant (Claude, Codex, ...) |

## 0. Decide the product
- **Quick answer + data** (default): "how much…", "chart…", "what was…", "pull the data on…".
- **Data only**: the user asks just for the data. Get it as §3 says, skip §4-§6, then run
  `python <skill>/scripts/fetch.py --handoff --out <out>` and reply with its `text` (per source: files with
  row counts, route, retrieval date, a short preview of each table), each source's caveats, and what could
  not be fetched with the route to get it; record choices made without the user in `decisions.json` (§1).
- **Report** (`"mode": "report"`) or **paper** (`"mode": "paper"`): only when asked. If unsure, give the
  quick answer and offer the report in one line.

## 1. Frame the question, and ask only what is critical
Write down the **measures** (each number the answer needs), the **universe**, the **period** (fiscal or
calendar years; the latest complete period, found from the data, not from memory), the **geography**, the
**dollar basis** (nominal, real with which index, per capita, share of GDP) and the **comparisons**.

Then collect the open choices that would change a headline number: the `clarify` list of each chosen
source (print it with `fetch.py --source <id> --clarify`, the full policy with `--policy`; never open
`sources/packs.json`, a large bundle read by code) plus these general ones: nominal vs real (and the deflator), fiscal vs calendar year,
geography level, data vintage (latest vs as first published), estimate vs margin of error (surveys),
weights and universe (microdata), answer vs report, and any download that will be large or slow (IPUMS
extracts).
- Ask in **one** round, at most 4 questions, with your question tool when available; each offers
  exactly one "Don't know — decide for me" option (never a separate "Skip"), your recommended option first.
- A skipped or unanswered question is a "Don't know". Exception: a **blocking** question (what the user
  means: which program, place, population or product) has no defensible default. After a skip, ask it once
  more; if still unanswered, use the most literal reading and say so in the answer's opening paragraph (its
  `disclosures` line, word for word).
- Skip what the request already settles (`"reason_code": "settled_by_request"`, `"request"`: the user's words).
  A one-number lookup with an obvious convention needs none.
- Non-interactive runs (`"reason_code": "no_user"`) only when nobody can answer: a headless or scheduled
  run. A chat with a question tool is interactive: ask. Then decide each by precedent (how the agency itself
  reports it), run the main alternative as a sensitivity check when it could change the conclusion, and put
  one line per unasked question in `decisions.json` → `disclosures` for the answer to carry.
- Record every question in `<out>/decisions.json` → `questions` (options, answer or `dont_know`, `how`:
  dont_know | skipped | not_asked, the `resolution` and the `assumption` it sets). The schema is in the
  docstring of `scripts/report/method_audit.py`.

## 2. Choose the sources
```bash
python <skill>/scripts/fetch.py --route "real wages of federal workers since 2015"
python <skill>/scripts/fetch.py --sources            # all packs, one line each
```
Split the question into measures and give each its source; `references/routing.md` lists the usual
pairings (debt/GDP → treasury + bea; real wages → bls or ipums + CPI; spending per person → usaspending +
census). Prefer the agency that produces a statistic over a re-publisher (BLS over FRED for CPI detail;
FRED for long histories, vintages and one-stop series). Cross-check every headline number with a second
source or the agency's published table when one exists. Then **read each chosen pack's `source.md`** (and
only those). Deep packs (ipums, bls, fred, bea, treasury, opm) have extra guides in `sources/<id>/docs/`;
read one only when `source.md` points you to it for the task at hand.
A figure that only an agency page publishes (a dashboard, a PDF table) and no pack serves goes in
`<out>/published/<name>.csv`, as the page shows it, with `source_url` and `accessed` (YYYY-MM-DD) on every
row (never under `data/`, which holds pack downloads). Register facts from it like any CSV and say in the
answer that the figure was read from that page.

## 2b. Search the literature and methods (every product)
Before choosing definitions and parameters, search for the agency's methodology (handbook, technical notes,
release notes) and for agency or peer-reviewed research behind any parameter the answer needs (thresholds,
elasticities, equivalence scales, multipliers, adjustment factors). Use a web search or fetch tool when one
is available. Open what you cite. Record each query, its date and what it found in `decisions.json` →
`literature_search`, with an empty `found` and a note when nothing relevant turned up. Record each opened
source in `references` (`citation`, `url`, `accessed`, `opened: true`, `used_for`). A search or fetch tool
you can load (a deferred tool) counts as available. Only with none, or a network that blocks them all, record
`{"unavailable": true, "reason_code": "no_search_tool" | "network_blocked" | "tool_unavailable"}` plus `disclosures.literature`, the
line the answer carries. Never cite what you have not opened.

## 3. Get the data by the best route
`<out>` is the analysis folder: `<short-name>/` inside the folder your environment gives for deliverables
(where files you hand to the user belong), else `out/<short-name>/` in the directory the session started in
(never above it, even after a `cd`), unless the user names one.
Write the spec(s) as `source.md` shows.

**One source:**
```bash
python <skill>/scripts/fetch.py --source <id> <out>/spec.json --out <out> --check
```
**Several sources:** write `<out>/plan.json`
(`{"description": "...", "sources": [{"source": "treasury", "spec": {...}}, {"source": "bea", "spec": {...}}]}`):
```bash
python <skill>/scripts/fetch.py --plan <out>/plan.json --out <out> --check
```
`--check` probes the hosts, the key and `<out>/data/<id>/`, and prints `route`, `message` (what to tell
the user), `action` (what you do next) and `next_command`. A plan check returns `ready` and `need_user`.
**Follow the route; never improvise another way of getting data.** Run `--check` before the first fetch of
every source and after every new or edited spec (a fetch of an unchecked spec says so in `check_reminder`).
Three paths, each with its own rule:
- **What a pack's API serves** comes only through fetch.py. Find its columns, datasets, codes or lookup
  lists (agencies, categories) with `--search`, `--endpoints`, `source.md` or a small probe spec
  (`max_rows`), never by querying that API yourself. When it returns less than the question needs (a
  column, filter or record), fix the spec; if the pack cannot, deliver what it returns and name the gap in
  `data_needs` and the answer.
- **A file from a pack's documented keyless or manual route** (`keyless_file`, `keyless_alternative`, a
  bundle download, an upload) is downloaded as that route says and enters through the source's `--ingest`,
  which writes its dictionary and provenance. An unattended run downloads only a pack's `keyless_file`
  (see `run_setup` below).
- **Figures read from an agency page** (`published/`, §2) and the methods, literature and benchmark pages
  (§2b, §4) keep those sections' routes.

| `route` | Meaning | Do this |
|---|---|---|
| `reuse_existing` | the data are already in `<out>/data/<id>/` | continue at §4 (offer `--force` if stale) |
| `api`, `api_keyless`, `bulk` | the source answers from here | run `next_command`; for `api_keyless`, tell the user once what a key adds |
| `run_setup` | a key is needed; the user has a terminal | give them `run_command` (`setup.ps1 -Source <id>` / `setup.sh <id>`) to run **themselves**; never ask for a key in chat; offer `keyless_alternative` (or the one `source.md` Access names); rerun `--check` when they say it is stored. With no user (`no_user`): download only a `keyless_file` (a direct, small file the pack's `--ingest` reads and filters) and run it through `ingest_command`; without one (an interactive page, a large bulk file, a file you would have to filter yourself), do not fetch: report the data as not fetched, with `run_command` |
| `cloud_secret` | key needed in a cloud session | add the variable to the environment's secrets and restart, or use the bundle |
| `cloud_allowlist` | the cloud network blocks the host | allow the hosts listed, or use the bundle |
| `manual_download` | this environment cannot get the data (a hosted chat with network off or the host not allowed, a sandbox, a key that cannot be stored here) | send `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, both `download_scripts` (`.sh` for macOS/Linux, `.ps1` for Windows: the request is built in, they ask for any key with hidden input and download everything) and the request (`request_spec` / `request_body`: spec.json, IPUMS extract_spec.json) with your file-sending tool when available, and print the paths; give the user the one command for their system (`user_commands`, e.g. `bash ~/Downloads/download_data.sh`; both when unsure), never a Python command; wait for the upload, then run `next_command` with the uploaded files (or their folder) after `--ingest` |
| `fix_spec` | the spec names something the source does not have | fix it with `--search` / `--endpoints` / `source.md`, rerun `--check` |
| `install_deps` | an optional package is missing | install only if the network allows; otherwise the pack's fallback |
| `report_error` | the user's own machine cannot reach the source | tell the user (internet, VPN, proxy) and stop |

With several sources, fetch the ready ones at once (`--plan ... --out <out>` without `--check`) and ask
the user **once** for everything in `need_user` (one bundle covers every standard source; deep packs add
their own bundle folders, listed in `other_bundles`). After uploads: `--plan ... --ingest`.
A second fetch that depends on the first (the laws, then each law's bill record) can use a new spec for the
same standard source and `<out>`: `request.json` keeps the earlier fetch under `earlier_fetches`. One request
per row of that first table: `"for_each": {"csv": "data/<id>/<table>.csv", "column": "packageId", "param":
"packageId"}` (path relative to the spec's folder; `--check` counts the calls); several parameters:
`"map": {"billType": "type", "billNumber": "number"}, "lower": true`; `"strip": "PN"` drops a prefix. The rows
come back as one table. The deep
packs (bea, bls, fred, ipums, opm, treasury) keep only the latest spec's record: put all their requests in one
spec, or give the second step its own `<out>`.

In a hosted chat sandbox (claude.ai, ChatGPT, Codex cloud) there are no setup scripts and no stored keys:
keyless routes work if the network settings allow the host; keyed data comes by manual download, or the
user runs the request in a coding agent on their own computer (Claude Code, Codex). If Python itself is missing, say so; for a single published number only, you may read the
API's JSON with a fetch tool and quote it with its URL and date. Never estimate or recall numbers instead.

## 4. Analyze in `<out>/analysis.py`
```python
import os, sys
sys.dont_write_bytecode = True                   # never write __pycache__ into the skill folder
OUT = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
SKILL = r"<skill>"
PACKS = ["treasury", "bea"]                      # the packs whose lib/ helpers you use
# copies in <out>/lib first (a replication package has only those), the skill's folders as the fallback
sys.path[:0] = [os.path.join(OUT, "lib")] + [os.path.join(OUT, "lib", p) for p in PACKS]
sys.path += [os.path.join(SKILL, "scripts", "analysis")] + [os.path.join(SKILL, "sources", p, "lib") for p in PACKS]
from facts import Facts
from combine import fiscal_year, to_fiscal, align_check, deflate, state, pack_lib
# helpers with one name in two packs (tsstats: bls, fred; stats: bea, ipums, opm) shadow each other on
# sys.path: load each by pack instead, e.g. fred_ts = pack_lib("fred", "tsstats", OUT, SKILL)
```
Read each source's files from `<out>/data/<id>/` (the data dictionary and README say what each column
is), compute everything in this one script, write exhibit tables to `<out>/exhibits/`, and register every
number the text will cite:
```python
facts = Facts(OUT)
facts.add("debt_gdp_fy2025", t, where={"fiscal_year": 2025}, column="pct", source="exhibits/exhibit_1.csv",
          fmt="pct100:1", label="Debt held by the public, percent of GDP, FY2025", pack="treasury")
facts.save()
```
Accuracy checklist (each item prevents a silent error):
- **Units and scaling**: name them in every table; convert once (thousands, millions, chained dollars).
- **Stocks vs flows**: end-of-period or average for levels and rates; sums for flows; never sum
  year-to-date values or stock levels.
- **Periods**: fiscal years run October to September and are named for the year they end; label partial
  periods; compare the same months; never present an incomplete period as complete (`to_fiscal` flags it).
- **Revisions and vintages**: say which vintage you used. BLS (footnote P) and OPM (first release) flag
  preliminary values; BEA and others do not, though their latest periods are early estimates: register those
  facts with `preliminary=True` (a period already through an annual revision is not early: the pack's
  `source.md` says which, e.g. BEA's annual update).
- **Surveys and microdata**: weighted estimates with standard errors or margins of error; name the weight;
  small cells are unreliable; ACS 1-year vs 5-year are not interchangeable.
- **Benchmark**: compare each headline with the agency's published figure and say whether it matches.
- **Evidence before judgment**: give each key definition and parameter a basis in `decisions.json` →
  `assumptions`, from strongest to weakest: **empirical** (estimate it from the data in `analysis.py`; the
  evidence names the exhibit CSV or `{{fact}}`), **literature** or **precedent** (a published estimate or the
  agency's practice, cited as an opened `[@ref]`; a pack's `source.md` is a guide, so cite the agency or IPUMS
  page it names), **user** (the user's answer). Use **judgment** only when none
  of these can settle it. Then state `why_not_empirical`, run the alternative, and record the row in
  `exhibits/sensitivity.csv` (parameter, base, alternative, headline_base, headline_alt, conclusion_changes).
- **Data that would improve it**: in `decisions.json` → `data_needs`, list the data that would replace each
  judgment call or unchecked benchmark (`data`, `improves`: the parameters or measures, `effect`, `how_to_get`,
  `from_user`: true when only the user has it). Use `[]` plus a `data_needs_note` when nothing would help.
- **Benchmarks** go in `exhibits/benchmark.csv` (measure, period, computed, published, source, url,
  accessed, match, note), one number per cell in the published figure's units (a bound as `over 45`). The audit compares computed
  with published within the published rounding: a larger gap needs a `note` with its cause (definition,
  vintage, universe), stated in the answer; otherwise find the error. Write "not checked" in `published` when
  no published figure exists.
- Each source's own traps are in its `source.md`. Read them.

## 5. Combining sources
Before any join or ratio across sources:
1. Same **period basis** (fiscal vs calendar; `to_fiscal`), same frequency, complete periods only.
2. Same **geography codes** (`combine.state` / `add_state_codes`; FIPS vs USPS vs names).
3. Same **units and dollar basis** (nominal vs real; one deflator for the whole analysis, named, with its
   base period: `deflate`).
4. Compatible **vintages and coverage** (e.g. OPM excludes USPS and intelligence agencies; IPUMS samples
   cover the civilian noninstitutional population): state differences in the methods.
5. `align_check({"treasury": t, "bea": g}, on=["fiscal_year"], units={"treasury": "$M, nominal, FY", "bea": "$B
   SAAR, FY average"})` (units keyed by the same names as the frames) before merging; it refuses missing or repeated keys, no
   overlap and unnamed units, and reports keys that drop out. It prints units but cannot compare them: convert first.
6. Cite every source; each fact records its pack. Each source's rules still apply to its own files.

## 6. Quick answer (default product)
Reply with: the answer in 2–4 sentences with the key numbers, the measure named exactly, the period and
the data date; a small markdown table when there is a series or breakdown (rounded, units in the header);
how each "Don't know" was decided and any sensitivity that matters; every line in `disclosures`, word for
word (what the audit could not check); the basis of each key assumption;
the literature consulted; the benchmark check; **"Data that would sharpen this"**: at most three entries
from `data_needs`, the ones that would most change a headline, those the user can supply first, offered as
a next step; links to `data/<id>/`, `analysis.py`, `exhibits/`, `facts.json` and `decisions.json`; the route
each source came by and its retrieval date (`fetch.py --handoff` lists them); one line offering the full report.
Write the reply exactly as you will send it to `<out>/answer.md`, then run the gate and fix every FAIL
until it prints `AUDIT PASSED`. The gate reads `answer.md`: every number must be a registered fact as its
format shows it, or a published figure from `benchmark.csv` at its published precision, credited to its
publisher in its sentence or column header; a table cell must be a fact registered for its row (give table
facts `where=` the row's label as printed, and each period in its own field: `{"fiscal_year": "2026", "month": "12"}`,
not one string `"FY2026 December"`) (a number that is not a statistic goes in
`decisions.json` → `audit_allow` as `{"value", "reason"}`); a cited fact stored on a rounding tie (21.55 printed
as 21.6) needs full precision in the exhibit or a `rounding_ties_ok` entry `{"fact", "reason"}` when the value is
exact (published at that precision); every `disclosures` line must be there word for
word; preliminary, projected and past-vintage facts must be called so; direction words must agree with the sign
(register a fall as a negative change, or label a positive size "decline"/"drop"); each source's required statements
(its `audit_hooks`; wording in `data/<id>/README.md` and `--clarify`) must appear. In prose, a number right after a name the facts are keyed by ("Colorado
(19.8 percent)"), the one row its clause names, or a measure acronym in its label ("CPI-U, up 26.5"), and a
number with a year beside it ("in 2024", "1929 (0.55") must be a fact of that year (so give facts a `label`
and their period in `where`); otherwise the gate proves each number is some registered fact,
not that it is the right one for its sentence, and it skips ranges ("40-50"), numbers in words outside tables (write counts as
facts.json prints them, in digits; but "three of the four" in words, when the answer's table has four rows, is checked as a count fact), years, dates and
identifiers (bill, law, executive order, table and statute numbers, codes) and ages ("16 and over"): before sending, read each number and date against
its fact by name.
```bash
python <skill>/scripts/report/audit_answer.py <out> --online --rerun
```
Send `answer.md` as audited. A chart is optional (a PNG in `<out>/exhibits/` or an artifact), with units in
the axis title.

## 7. Report or paper (only when asked)
Read `references/report_patterns.md` and `references/style_guide.md`, and each used pack's report notes in
its `source.md`. Extend the §2b search to the agency release, the dataset page and related publications.
Record each source in `decisions.json` (the builder merges its references, assumptions, questions,
literature and data needs into Appendix A) and cite it as `[@id]`. Write `<out>/report.json` (schema: docstring of `scripts/report/build_report.py`), with every
number as `{{fact_name}}` or `{{fact_name|fmt}}` and a `sources` list of the pack ids used. Then:
```bash
python <skill>/scripts/report/style_check.py <out>/report.json
python <skill>/scripts/report/build_report.py <out>/report.json
python <skill>/scripts/report/audit_report.py <out>/report.json --online --rerun
```
Fix every FAIL and rebuild until the audit prints `AUDIT PASSED`; never hand-edit the HTML. The builder
applies each source's policy: required notices; redistribution (IPUMS microdata never leaves the analysis
folder: the package carries the extract definition and `reproduce/<id>/` one-command download scripts
(`.sh`/`.ps1`, request built in, attached to the page) instead; FRED series that need
pre-approval are withheld from shared files); data-vintage blocks; and each source's audit hooks (OPM
coverage and redaction disclosure, survey standard errors, Census margins of error).

## 8. Hand off
Give the headline answer, the product type, links (`report.html`, `replication_package.zip`, `data/`,
`analysis.py`, `facts.json`, `decisions.json`, `exhibits/`), the decisions and sensitivities, the benchmark
result, the data that would improve the estimates, each source's route and retrieval date, and that the
audit passed. Send `report.html` with the file-sending tool
when one is available.

## Integrity rules
- Never invent, estimate from memory, simulate or "illustrate" a number. If data cannot be downloaded,
  say so and give the user the route to get it.
- Every number in an answer comes from `analysis.py` through `facts.json` or an exhibit CSV.
- Every choice that could move a headline is in `decisions.json` with its basis. Judgment is the last
  resort and always comes with a sensitivity test.
- Keys are never printed, logged, written to a file or requested in chat, and never looked for by listing or
  searching environment variables or settings files (`env`, `printenv`, `set`, `grep`): `--check` says
  whether a key is set (`key_source`, `key_ok`) without showing it.
- Respect each source's terms: its redistribution rule, required notices and citation (in `data/<id>/README.md`).
- Say how current the data are, and cite every source with its retrieval date.
